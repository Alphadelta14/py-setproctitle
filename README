A ``setproctitle`` implementation for Python
============================================

:author: Daniele Varrazzo

The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools
such as ``ps`` and ``top``).

The procedure is hardly portable across different systems.
A `good implementation`_ is provided by PostgreSQL_. This module is a wrapper
around it.
