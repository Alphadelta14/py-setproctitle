~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Module works on BSD (tested on FreeBSD 7.2).

- Module works on Windows. Many thanks to `Develer`_ which provided a neat `GCC
  package for Windows with Python integration`__ that made the Windows porting
  painless.

  Notice that on Windows there is no way to change the process string.
  What the module does is to create a Named Object whose value can be read
  in tools such as Process Explorer.
